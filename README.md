# SeeSpot
SeeSpot is on a mission to improve the life of pets by empowering the people who love them. By combining database tracking and GPS technology, SeeSpot aims to create a method of tracking to be shared by a whole family. SeeSpot offers the possibility to track your pets behavior via walks, meals, and potty breaks. 

Users have the option to record the route, distance, and duration of each walk, along with the option to add bathroom stop info. Users can also monitor when a pet was fed. SeeSpot is a great way to create lasting memories and record activities of their beloved buds.
